# Fix the backend issues (2025-06-05 12:52:17)

_**User**_

@/back_end can you fix the backend?

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you fix the backend. Let's first examine the structure of the backend code to understand what needs to be fixed.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory server â€¢ **2** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| ðŸ“„ `pom.xml` |
| ðŸ“„ `new-pom.xml` |

</details>

---

Let me check the contents of these pom files to understand the project structure.

---

Read file: server/pom.xml

---

Let me check the new-pom.xml file to see what differences there might be:

---

Read file: server/new-pom.xml

---

Now let's check if there's a Java source code structure in the server directory:

---

Could not resolve URI: Error: Unable to resolve nonexistent file 'c:\Users\joel_\OneDrive\Escritorio\apps gym\server\src'

---

Let's look at what else is in the server directory:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory server â€¢ **2** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| ðŸ“„ `pom.xml` |
| ðŸ“„ `new-pom.xml` |

</details>

---

I notice a few issues that need to be fixed:

1. There is no source code structure in the server directory. A Spring Boot application needs a src/main/java directory structure.
2. The POM file has an invalid tag `<n>server</n>` which should be `<name>server</name>`.
3. There are two POM files (pom.xml and new-pom.xml), and the only difference is the Lombok version (1.18.30 vs 1.18.32).

Let's fix these issues:

1. First, let's fix the POM file:

Let's try using search_replace instead:

Let me read the file again to check for any whitespace differences:

Let's first create the proper directory structure for a Spring Boot application:
